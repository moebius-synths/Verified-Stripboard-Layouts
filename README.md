# Verified-Stripboard-Layouts

I'm Markus, based in Berlin. Here you can find all my selfmade stripboard layouts for diy modular synths. I've build everything you can find here myself using these layouts. My boards may seem a bit crowded, but I like to keep my panels small to get more from the space I got in my case. That's because you find some chaotic jumper wiring on my boards. Nevertheless I try my best to make everything as clear as possible, so can follow it through without any trouble. Just be patient and try to be accurate during the building process. No one wants to troubleshoot instead of exploring sonic adventures right away! 

Also special thanks to Eddy Bergman. His website is what really got me going on building synth modules on stripboards.

So enjoy the fun of building your own synth on a budget and it'd mean a lot to me, if my layouts contribute to your system! :)
